# Classification 

In this part, we want to resolve a problem with various methods of classification : 
- Logistic regression 
- K-Nearest Neigbors
- Support Vector Machine 
- Naive Bayes 

 ## Comparison of these methods 

| Methods|Pro|Con|
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| Logistic regression  | Probabilistic approach, gives informations about statistical significance of features| The Logistic Regression Assumptions |
| K-Nearest Neigbors | Simple to understand, fast and efficient |Need to choose the number of neighbours k|
| Support Vector Machine  | Performant, not biased by outliers, not sensitive to overfitting| Not appropriate for non linear problems, not the best choice for large number of features |
| Naive Bayes  | Efficient, not biased by outliers, works on nonlinear problems, probabilistic approach | Based on the assumption that features have same statistical relevance|
| Random Forest Classification | Powerful and accurate, good performance on many problems, including non linear | No interpretability, overfitting can easily occur, need to choose the number of trees|
