# Clustering

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning problem** in which our goal is to discover “clusters” in the
data. <br>
A cluster is a collection of data that are similar in some way.  It can also be used to compress
data, by replacing all of the elements in a cluster with a single representative element.

In this part, we want to resolve a problem with various methods of clustering : 
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering 

 ## Comparison of these methods 

| Methods|Pro|Con|
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| K-means clustering | Simple to understand, easily adaptable, works well on small or large datasets,fast, efficient and performant| Need to choose the number of clusters |
| Hierarchical clustering | The optimal number of clusters can be obtained by the model itself, practical, visualisation with the dendrogram | Not appropriate for large datasets|
