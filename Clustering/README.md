# Clustering

In this part, we want to resolve a problem with various methods of regression : 
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering 


 ## Comparison of these methods 

| Methods|Pro|Con|
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| K-means clustering | Simple to understand, easily adaptable, works well on small or large datasets,fast, efficient and performant| Need to choose the number of clusters |
| Hierarchical clustering | The optimal number of clusters can be obtained by the model itself, practical, visualisation with the dendrogram | Not appropriate for large datasets|
