# Machine Learning for data sciences 

In following the course of [Machine learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning) at Udemy, I have worked on machine learning for data sciences. 

Table of content : 
## I. Data preprocessing
## II. Supervised learning : the training data is labeled with the correct answers
- Regression (finished)
- Classification (finished)

## III. Unsupervised learning
- Clustering 
- Dimension reduction 

## IV. Reinforcement learning
- Upper Confidence Bound 
- Thompson Sampling

## V. Deep learning

- Artificial Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks 



Each time, the course furnished a dataset with a problem to analyze. 

## Objectives 

- Understand and analyze different algorithms 
- Implement them in python

## Introduction
