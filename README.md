# Machine Learning for data sciences 

In following the course of [Machine learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning) at Udemy, I have worked on machine learning for data sciences. 

Table of content : <br>
**I. Data preprocessing** <br>
**II. Supervised learning** : the training data is labeled with the correct answers
- Regression (finished)
- Classification (finished)<br>

**III. Unsupervised learning** <br>
- Clustering 
- Dimension reduction <br>

**IV. Reinforcement learning**<br>
- Upper Confidence Bound 
- Thompson Sampling <br>

**V. Deep learning** <br>
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks 



Each time, the course furnished a dataset with a problem to analyze. 

## Objectives 

- Understand and analyze different algorithms 
- Implement them in python

## More 

This lesson is only used as a guide. There are often some sidetracks about subjects i want study deeper.
