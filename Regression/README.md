# Regression 

In this part, we want to resolve a problem with various methods of regression : 
  - Multiple linear regression with **backpropagation elimination** and **forward selection** 
  - Polynomial regression 
  - Support Vector regression 
  - Random Forest Tree regression 


 ## Comparison of these methods 

| Methods|Pro|Con|
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| Multiple linear regression    | Works on any size of dataset and gives information about the relevance of features| Needs respect the linear regression assumptions  |
| Polynomial regression         | Works on any size of dataset and is better on non-linear problems |Needs to choose the good polynomial degree for a good bias/variance tradeoff|
| SVR                           | Easily adaptable, Work very well on a non-linear problem, Non-biased by outliers |   Compulsory to apply features calling, Not well know and more difficult to understand|
| Random Forest Tree regression | Powerful and accurate, Good performance on many problems including non-linear |  No interpretability, Overfitting can easily occur, Need to choose the number of trees |
